  In the darkest part of the night you are awoken to banging
on your chamber doors. You wearily slip out of bed to
answer, slipping on your kingly Mk{purple robe}. Who would dare
disturb the royal sleep, especially at this hour?

  Behind the door you find the castle's head wizard, winded
and sweating from racing up the winding stairs to your
bedroom. The long beard certainly didn't help matters. He
looked anxious to deliver important news, but was waiting
patiently for your response.

  "I hope this is important," you say with a yawn, refusing to
budge from the doorway, lest the wizard try to push his way
in.

  "My  interruption  is  of   the  utmost  importance,  your
majesty. It's the Yk{figurine}! I think I've discovered its true
nature. We can put an end to this invasion."

  "Go on." You  beckon the wizard into the room.  You take a
seat  on the  side of  your bed  next to  the crumbled  silk
sheets.

  "The  Yk{figurine} was  created  millennia ago  by an  ancient
human civilization. It's purpose  was not to attract Rk{goblins}
towards something.  It was meant  to attract them  away from
the  civilized  regions  of  the  world.  Unfortunately  our
settlement just happened  to pick one of  the spots selected
for one of these artifacts."

  You interrupt, "How does this knowledge up us?"

  "You didn't let  me finish, your majesty.  The creators of
the  Yk{artifact} anticipated  our  dilemma.  The Yk{artifact}  will
automatically  shut down  after a  certain number  of unique
human individuals have touched it.  That way if the Yk{artifact}
were to find its way to  a human civilization, it would shut
down before causing its destruction."

  "How many people will it take?"

  "By  my estimates,  Mk{we'll need  4,000 people}.  If you  can
build enough Ck{hamlets}  to attract 4,000 people  to live under
your rule, I'll have the  Yk{figurine} sent around the realm for
each man,  woman, and  child to  touch. If  I and  the other
wizards  are  correct,  the   Rk{goblins}  will  instantly  lose
interest in our island when the Yk{artifact} shuts down."

  "That  sounds like  some stupid  gimmick that  a bad  game
designer came up with in a  rush before a deadline. But I'll
do it. Building that sort of infrastrucure could take, like,
seven days. But first, I have sleep to finish."
