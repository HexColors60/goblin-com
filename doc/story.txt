                  The Origin of Ck{Goblin-COM}

  You are  the king of  a fledgling, human island  nation. A
few  months ago  while the  dungeons underneath  your castle
were being expanded, something  interesting and terrible was
unearthed. It was an ancient obsidian Yk{figurine} of a menacing
Rk{goblin}. The mages  warned that it pulsed dark  energy like a
beacon.

  Within  a matter  of  weeks, Rk{goblin}  raids  on the  island
suddenly  increased.  Many  were  kiled.  The  Yk{figurine}  was
calling them.

  To deal  with this  threat, Ck{Goblin-COM}, the  Goblin Combat
Unit was created. It was made  up of the greatest heroes the
island had to offer. While Ck{Goblin-COM} fends off the goblins,
you  must  figure  out  how  to  deal  with  the  mysterious
figurine. Perhaps it  can be destroyed, but  the mages don't
yet know how.
