                  The Origin of Ck{Goblin-COM}

  You  are the  ruler of  a fledgling,  young, human  island
nation. A  few months ago,  a rogue illegally  exploring the
dungeons   and  caves   underneath  your   castle  unearthed
something  interesting  and  terrible.  It  was  an  ancient
obsidian Yk{figurine}  of a  menacing Rk{goblin}. The  castle wizard
warned  that  it pulsed  with  dark  energy like  a  beacon.
Trouble would soon follow.

  Within  a matter  of  weeks, Rk{goblin}  raids  on the  island
suddenly  increased.  Many  were  kiled.  The  Yk{figurine}  was
calling them.

  To deal  with this  threat, Ck{Goblin-COM}, the  Goblin Combat
Unit was created. It was made  up of the greatest heroes the
island had to offer. While Ck{Goblin-COM} fends off the goblins,
you  must  figure  out  how  to  deal  with  the  mysterious
figurine. Perhaps it can be destroyed, but the wizards don't
yet know how.
