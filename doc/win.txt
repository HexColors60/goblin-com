  The  head  wizard  looked  exhausted. His  beard  was  now
thinner than than when he was  a young student at the wizard
college.  For  the past  few  days  he'd been  carrying  the
Yk{artifact} across the realm to  visit each and every person on
record.  In some  cases people  were visited  twice or  even
three times, just  to be absolutely sure.  It was imperative
that no one was missed. An oversight could cost lives.

  Today  he arrived  at  a small,  hastily-built shack.  The
records indicated that a young couple lived here -- the last
two  people who  would  be visited  today.  If the  Yk{figurine}
didn't  respond now,  the  invasions would  continue for  at
least another day.

  The weary  old wizard  began his routine.  At the  door he
presented  the  official,  stamped decree,  then  asked  the
bewildered couple to hold the  Yk{artifact}. First the young man
held it, examining it.

  "This is what's  been causing all the  trouble?"

  "Not for much longer,"  the wizard answered, mumbling "...
I hope." The wizard gestured for the woman to hold it.

  Disgusted, handing back the Yk{figurine}, "Who would make such
an ugly thing?"

  The wizard held the figurine up  at eye level, giving it a
careful look.  Did anything change?  Maybe it felt  a little
lighter? Nothing seemed to be different.

  "Another day,"  he sighed, but was  interrupted by crying.
Pushing his way into the home, "What's that?"

  The woman answered smiling, "That's our Ck{newborn girl}. Just
two days ago. We haven't even picked out a name yet."

  The wizard quickly pulled out  his records. "That's not on
record, but  this scroll is  probably a couple of  days old.
Why didn't you mention her when I arrived?"

  The couple glanced at each other. "We didn't know children
counted."

  The wizard  frowned and continued back  towards the source
of  the crying.  In an  oversized crib  he saw  the smallest
little Ck{baby girl}, her tiny  little hands grasping at the air
above. She was almost no bigger than the Yk{figurine} itself.

  He  held the  Yk{figurine} towards  her and  she instinctively
grabbed at  it. As  soon as she  made contact,  the Yk{figurine}
flashed as bright  as the sun, causing the  wizard to almost
drop it. Just  as fast, the light stopped.  The Yk{figurine} had
transformed from obsidian into some sort of opal.

                            ...

  Within hours,  Ck{G-COM} reported that the  Rk{goblins} everywhere
were confused and fleeing. Celebrations began everywhere. It
was finally over. The touch of a Ck{newborn baby} ended the war.

                            ...

  What would now happen to the opal artifact? It was decided
that  it should  be returned  to  the dungeon  where it  was
found. Mk{All that was needed was a brave rogue to do it.}
