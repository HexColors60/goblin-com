            ├────────── Rk{Game Over} ──────────┤

  Despite the best effort of  your heroes, laying down their
lives for  the sake of  all, supported the industry  of your
people, you have  failed to stop the  goblin onslaught. With
your nation in  tatters around it, the  goblins stormed your
castle, killed everyone they could find, and left victorious
with the mysterious artifact.

  Only a  few survivors live to  tell the tale. All  that is
known of  the artifact by human  civilization, including its
very  existence, is  lost in  defeat. What  purpose will  it
serve in  the future? Will  this make the  goblins stronger,
further  threatening the  region? Perhaps  the other  island
nations will  fare better when  the goblins arrive  at their
shores.
