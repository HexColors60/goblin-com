├───────────── Gk{An Apology from the Developer} ──────────────┤

  There was  supposed to be  a battlescape thing  here where
you fight the goblins in  turn-based battle, X-COM style. As
usual  for 7DRL,  that  was  too ambitious  for  a one  week
project, so it was cut. I'd  like to finish this part in the
future, outside of 7DRL, so check  back some other time in a
future version.

  So sorry. Please  accept this automatic win  for this, and
all future battles!

  There's  still a  story, though,  so keep  playing. (Hint:
Mk{keep growing your population} while fending off goblins.)
